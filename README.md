## usage

### scrapping
When scrapping is 100%, the data should be fetched using a simple:
    $ make scrape

When developing/debugging the scrapper, use something like `python3.11 -m IPython` then execute the script with `run scripts/getHymns.py`, and inspect objects in IPython. Change script code and run it again inside IPython.

### website
For now a dummy website available at https://da1me.github.io/
